## üöÄ Quick Start

### Install Laracheck Server

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/officineweb/laracheck.git
cd laracheck

# Install dependencies
composer install

# Setup environment
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate

# Configure database in .env, then migrate
php artisan migrate

# Create admin user (admin@laracheck.test / Password123!)
php artisan db:seed --class=AdminUserSeeder
```

Customize Url and Database into your .env file if neeeded.

Configure SMTP in your `.env`:

```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io
MAIL_PORT=2525
MAIL_USERNAME=your_username
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_password
```

### Configure Your First Site

1. **Create a site** in the Laracheck dashboard
2. **Copy your API key** from the "Setup" button and follow the steps
3. **Configure your app** installing the Client via Composer and configuring:

```env
LARACHECK_KEY=your-api-key-here
LARACHECK_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

4. **Register exception tracking** in `bootstrap/app.php`:

```php
->withExceptions(function (Exceptions $exceptions): void {
    app('laracheck')->track($exceptions);
})
```

That's it! Exceptions will now be tracked automatically. üéâ

## üìñ Key Concepts

### Exception Management

-   **4xx errors** (404, 403, etc.) are automatically marked as fixed with no notifications
-   **5xx errors** (500, 503, etc.) trigger immediate alerts and require manual resolution
-   **Batch notifications** every 5 minutes prevent alert fatigue
-   **Markdown export** for easy sharing

### Uptime Monitoring

-   Checks run **every minute** for enabled sites
-   **Outage detection** with automatic resolution tracking
-   **Multi-channel alerts** (Email, Slack, Discord)
-   **Downtime statistics** with duration tracking

### User & Permission Management

-   **Admins** have full access to all sites and settings
-   **Regular users** only see assigned sites
-   **Site owners** can manage their own sites
-   **2FA support** with app and email authentication

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

-   PHP 8.2 or higher
-   MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite
-   Composer 2

## üîß Configuration

### Email Notifications

Configure SMTP in your `.env`:

```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io
MAIL_PORT=2525
MAIL_USERNAME=your_username
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_password
```

### Slack & Discord Webhooks

Add webhook URLs directly in site settings through the admin panel.

### Scheduled Tasks

Laracheck runs the following scheduled tasks:

-   **Uptime Checks**: Every minute - monitors site availability
-   **Exception Notifications**: Every 5 minutes - sends batched alerts
-   **Data Cleanup**: Daily at midnight - removes old data based on retention policy

Make sure the Laravel scheduler is running:

```bash
* * * * * cd /path-to-laracheck && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

Or use Laravel's built-in scheduler:

```bash
php artisan schedule:work
```

### Data Retention

By default, Laracheck keeps exceptions and outages for **365 days**. Configure in `.env`:

```env
DATA_RETENTION_DAYS=365
```

See [Data Retention Documentation](DATA-RETENTION.md) for more details.
